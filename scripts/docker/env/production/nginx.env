# Let's Encrypt certificates for https encryption. You must have a domain name as HTTPS_HOST (doesn't work
# with an ip) and it must be reachable from the outside. This can be one of the following :
# disabled : we do not get a certificate at all (a placeholder certificate will be used)
# staging : we get staging certificates (are invalid, but allow to test the process completely and have much higher limit rates)
# production : we get a normal certificate (default)
#LETSENCRYPT_MODE=disabled
